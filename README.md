Inline-Editor.js Tool for Editor.js

## ðŸ’¡ Motivation

Editor.js inline tools are need to control DOM directly,
so they may be able to provide only simple functions.
By launching another Editor.js instance as inline element,
existing block tools can be reused as inline tool.

By using with [editorjs-style](https://github.com/hata6502/editorjs-style),
Editor.js can be used like a HTML editor.

**Note: This is an experimental inline tool ðŸ”¬**
