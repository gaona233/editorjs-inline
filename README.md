Inline-Editor.js Tool for Editor.js

## ðŸ’¡ Motivation

Editor.js inline tools are need to control DOM directly,
so they may be able to provide only simple functions.
By launching another Editor.js instance as inline element,
existing block tools can be reused as inline tool.

**Note: This is an experimental inline tool ðŸ”¬**
